# Milestone CHANGELOG

## 1.21.5 -> Introduction to BlueMaps
- Upgrade to Minecraft 1.21.5!
- Moving away from Dynmap due to multiple issues with MySQL rendering and BlueMaps just generally having a better UI. Some key pointers on why BlueMaps is a better option:
    - Already supports 1.21.5, dynmap still does not (faster update times)
    - Better looking UI and allows for a spectator like view which is pretty cool
    - Fixes MySQL render issues of black screens after server restart
    - Supports multiple servers with one webui out of the box without the need for a third party tool like LiveAtlas.
    - Rendering is a LOT quicker

- [x] Upgraded servers to 1.21.5!
- [x] Added BlueMap support for both servers into one UI
- [x] Removed Dynmap plugin, mod and config files.
- [x] Removed LiveAtlas support
- [ ] Rcon mentioned in README
